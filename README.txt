Initially when you open http://159.203.124.196:3000, it will be redirected to http://159.203.124.196:3000/signin, where 
either yuo can signin or signup, you can use the credentials, [sai@gmail.com, '1234'], 


If you signup, initially in the home page , you cannot view anything , as we do not have any data, so we need to click on
'Configure Budget', and enter the budget and then  comeback to Home page to view the relavant graphs.

Then we can enter the monthly expenditure in 'Add Monthly Expenditure', and then compare it with the original budget , in 'View Monthly Expenditure ' tab.


I have written , the three types of test cases, unit test case -App.test.js, e2e test case - /cypress/e2e/FirstTest.cy.js ,
Visual Regression test - /cypress/integration/home.spec.js
